Hello, I prepared a custom notification component in react js by using the Context API and hooks. You can be downloaded and added to the project easily.
By using the Context API and hooks we create to efficiently dispatch notifications from anywhere your project and give feedback to the user.
In the example, the context is reached from the form component and the notification is created.

Special thanks for daryanka.
